Hi ,
This is Vidhyadhara Teja and my student id is A00433626. This is my prefered email- vidhyadharatejak@gmail.com . 

Professional Experience 

I don't have any prior Professional Experience. I worked as an Intern with a designation Data Scientist for 6 months.


Technologies

I'm familiar with technologies like C and JAVA. I am familiar with R (exploratory data analysis only ),Python and core c# aswell but need to brush up once.

As I'm not  good at  MVC frameworks . As i saw  .NET application was last group project that i need to work. Is there any other alternate technology that i can replace this .NET .
